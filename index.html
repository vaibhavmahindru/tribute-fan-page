      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Elon Musk is one of the most well known Silicon Valley CEOs of all time,
        but many only know what makes the headlines about the
        <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank">Tesla</a> and
        <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> executive.
        Dive deeper with Ladders into the life and career of Elon Musk.<br /><br />
        Musk was born on June 28, 1971, making him 48-years-old at the time of
        publication. Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, where he lived
        until he moved to Canada at age 17. He holds South African, Canadian,
        and U.S. citizenship. As of 2020, he lives in Los Angeles,
        California.<br /><br />
        Musk became a millionaire in 1999 at age 27 when he sold Zip2 (his
        web-software company) for over $340 million. With a 7% share of the
        company, Musk received $22 million for the deal. He reached
        billionaire-status in 2012 at age 40, debuting on Forbes Billionaires
        List with a net worth of $2 billion. Musk’s estimated net worth was $680
        million in October 2011. The jump had to do with Tesla Motors
        experiencing a 30% increase in stock price year over year. Tesla stock
        jumped when they introduced the Model X in February 2012. At the time,
        Musk’s 29% stake in Tesla was worth just over $1 billion.<br /><br />

        <br />
        <h2>Zip2 Corporation</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his
          brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing
          content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the
          Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation
          bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.

        /><br />
        <h2>PayPal</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2
          to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An
          X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as
          it is known today.
          <br />
          In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was
          acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk
          owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.

        /><br />
        <h2>SpaceX</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies
          Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building
          spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well
          established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo
          transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut
          transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle
          missions.

        <br />
        <h2>Tesla</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a
          company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable,
          mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs.
          Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the
          company's products.

        /><br />
        <h2>SolarCity Corp.</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In August 2016, in Musk’s continuing effort to promote and advance
          sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, a $2.6
          billion dollar deal was solidified to combine his electric car and
          solar energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all-stock
          deal purchase of SolarCity Corp., a company Musk had helped his
          cousins start in 2006. He is a majority shareholder in each entity.

        <h2>The Boring Company</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted
          to boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. He
          began with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles.
